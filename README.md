# gpr-for-gradle (Gradle Github Packages Plugin)

Currently this only supports the Gradle Kotlin-DSL. Here's a [Groovy alternative](https://github.com/jarnoharno/gradle-github-packages-plugin).

Have you ever tried to use GitHub Packages for your Java project, just to be disappointed by the fact that there isn't a public repo and everything requires credentials? Are disgusted by the idea of adding more than one line of code per repository to your build.gradle? 

You'll still need to [generate a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages), but at least now your build.gradle will look clean!
